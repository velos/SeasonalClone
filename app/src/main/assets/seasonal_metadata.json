    "Description": "Sprouting is the practice of germinating seeds so they can be eaten raw or cooked. Many seed types can be used as sprouts but mung beans, soy beans and alfalfa are commonly used. The sprouted beans are more nutritious than the original beans and require much less cooking time. Sprouts are said to be rich in digestible energy, bioavailable vitamins, minerals, amino acids, proteins, and phytochemicals, as these are necessary for a germinating plant to grow.",
