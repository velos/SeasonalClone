# SeasonalClone
SeasonalClone for Velos Weekend of Kotlin

This Project is part of a 2-day workshop by Velos Mobile to get Intermediate Android developers up to speed with Kotlin. 

There are a list of tasks that must be completed in order, and are meant to give developers hands-on practice with writing Kotlin syntax in the context of Android development.


## Prerequisites

- You are comfortable writing Android apps in Java
- You have an understanding of basic Kotlin syntax
- You are using Android Studio 3.0+ or Kotlin plugin

## What is SeasonalClone?

Velos Mobile just launched a small app called Seasonal (https://bit.ly/2J31WqQ) which lets you know about seasonal fruits and vegetables in your area in any given month.

It's built in 100% Kotlin, and we were able to really take advantage of what Kotlin has to offer.

SeasonalClone is an app that we will build during Velos Weekend of Kotlin which will have a few simple features that help you understand the essence of how to build an app like Seasonal as well as Kotlin.

## How this works

There are a number of tasks that we will work through during the workshop. All tasks can be found in the Wikis.

We encourage you to go through the tasks step-by-step listed in the Home page, and only refer to each of the individual task pages if necessary.

### Hints

- If you are not able to figure out how to write something in Kotlin, write it in Java and use the Java > Kotlin converter. If there are any errors, work through them one-by-one.
- Observe any highlighting that your IDE offers, and read the hints (E.g. Android Studio will tell you if a var can actually be made a val - immutable - if you haven't modified it anywhere else)
